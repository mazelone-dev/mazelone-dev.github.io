          <p>
            Mazelone is an AI company that turns complex, messy, real-world
            data into systems people can actually use.
          </p>
          <p>
            We build practical AI solutions that help organizations work with
            documents, language, images, and knowledge more intelligently. From
            multimodal understanding to agent-based retrieval and
            domain-specific AI systems, our focus is not on technology for its
            own sake, but on making AI useful in production.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe the future of work will be shaped by AI that understands
            how people really work — across documents, conversations, images,
            regulations, and operational knowledge. Our role is to make that
            intelligence reliable, usable, and deployable in the environments
            where it matters most.

            <p className="mt-4">
              We design AI systems that go beyond demos: systems that can
              understand complex enterprise data, retrieve the right information,
              support better decisions, and fit into real workflows. By combining
              strong research capability with product-minded engineering, we
              help companies adopt AI in ways that are grounded, scalable, and
              impactful.

            <p className="mt-3">
              At Mazelone, we care about more than model quality. We care about

            <p className="mt-4">
              We work with a strong sense of ownership, technical depth, and

              collaboration over silos. Our goal is to build systems that are
              not only intelligent, but trustworthy, maintainable, and aligned

              It should help people do meaningful work better — with less

              build that kind of AI: practical, reliable, and ready for the real
              world.
